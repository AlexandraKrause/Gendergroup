# Introduction
First technical Darft only!!!!!

## Gender equality in german farming

The ancient role model of the male and patriarch peasants is under deconstruction (Laoire, 2002). When looking at agricultural study couses and practical training classes, and social media, some scholars perceive a "feminization" of agriculture in Germany [@inhetveen2017feminization] - this upward trend of woman in agriculture is reflected in algricutural statistcs, which show that woman make up more than 36 % of the agricultural workers, 23% of agricultural apprentices and 48% of agricultural students are female. More and more snnovative and sucessfull woman farmers overcome traditional role models and claim their territory in this formerly male-dominated field. 

Unfortunately, this "feminization" is not reflected in the share of leadership positions and land ownership of woman.  Today, only 11 % of farm managers are female [@destatis2020] and only 1/3 of land is owned by females @tietz2021untersuchung. Many woman active in farming, assume the role of the wife or contributing family member. Here, womans labour is exploitet without adequate financial renumeration. In this position, woman have . The inbalance of a high workload without financial compensation do notyield adequate pension entitlements.In many family farms, the financial security of hard-working woman is at risk. This different ownership rights are also refected in the farm decision making process - 40 % of farmers’ wives claim that their husband decides alone on farm [@Umfrage]. 
 
## Pension of Farm wifes
The pension of farmers in Germany is usually a combination of agricultural insurance, leasing income from property or monthly allowance from successors. The statistically important group of in-maried woman often works full-time on farm, but depends financially on her husbands property. Women can be registered as contributing family members and thereby contribute to agricultural insurance. However, the agricultural pension entitlement is comparable to a pocket money and not designed to cover the cost of living of retirees. Revenues of leasing land during retirement go exclusively to the husband.In-married women usually do not own the farm, therefore depend on financial support by family and bear a high risk of old-age poverty. 
Aquiring independent pension entitlements is challenging for woman on farm. 
- First, their „patchwork employment biography“ limits their pension entitlement from other schemes.
- Patriacial traditiions demand child- and elderly care from woman, which is 





Farmers pension is challenged by structural change of traditional family farms. this applies especially to inmarried woman, who are. of property are challenes in agricultural pension insurance. 
This applies to farmers, but een more on their wifes. @do_decision_2020
In Germany, only 10 of farm managers are female and only one third 
of the land is owned by female.

Statistically the most important group woman farmaers are the wifes of farmers. These woman hold often responsibilities for several important tasks on the farm. 
The traditional organizational structre of family farms has the potentioal to exploit womans labour without pension entitlements. As womans retirement is mostly based on their husband, divorce or death of husband consitute major risks for their pension. 
In our study, we want to display different options that ensure woman farmers a safe pension entitlement. We compare the default option of no specific pension plan to adifferent pension plan options. Herby we conside the most important pension schemes relevan for woman in agricultre, which is agricultural insrance, state insurance, private insurance and etfs. With our research we would like to encourage woman farmers to demand monetary appreciation of thei work and consider risks to their family pension.  

Interventions that improve the pension of farm wifes have the potential to benefit the livelihoods of farmers and communities worldwide. However, given the high system complexity, the long-term benefits of 
pension schemes are difficult to anticipate. This study aimed to integrate
uncertainty into long-term performance projections for pension scheme interventions 
in Germany. We applied decision analysis and probabilistic modeling approaches 
to produce economic ex-ante assessments for for pension schemes
options (state pension, agricultural pension, etfs, private insurance) promoted in Germany. Our results
indicate that farmers likely prefer reinvesting the available money in farming technology and  due to the relatively early incomes and short time-lag on returns.
However, the results also show that annual profits from farming can be expected to decrease over time and mostly benefit the farm owner, which is often not the woman. Also structural changes in agriculture and the high give-up rates impose high insecurity on the future of the farm. However, long-term payments directed to their womans retirement. return substantial benefits to the wife and family in the long term, but they also incur high establishment and maintenance costs and will generate net losses in the first few years. Better access to information and self confidence to ak for a fair share of farming income  may help in promoting pension plans for inmaried woman in german farms. Uncertainties related to the communication culture in farming families, farmers’ values, farm profitability, and pension returns appeared to have the greatest influence on whether a retirement plan emerged as the preferable option. Narrowing these key knowledge gaps may offer additional clarity on farmers’ wifes optimal course of action and provide guidance for agencies promoting insurance interventions in Germany. Our model produced
a set of plausible ranges for net present values and highlighted critical variables, more clarity on which would support
decision-making under uncertainty. Our innovative research approach proved effective in providing forecasts of uncertain
outcomes and can be useful for informing similar development interventions in other contexts.

# Methods

## Identificaion of research priorities and stakeholder workshop
In our project, we intended to work on gender equality in German farming. After extensive literature research on woman farmers in germany, we identified the statistically important group of in-married woman in  question down to the pension of in-married woman in Germany.
Corresponding to our Research question, we identified experts and a community of "agrarfrauen" as our expert group. After drafting a first model based on literature resarch and personal experinces, we contacted potentiaal decision makers and experts. most of our experts wereconsultants that often deal with decisin makers. after conducting our participatory workshop and several refinements, we came up with an improved model.

## Model Sketch
Decision option 1 

aka Default option: Woman has an apprentinship as gardener. She marries a farmer 
and starts working ful time on farm. She is fcially registered as a farm wife 
and therefore pays in the agricultural insurance. 

Decision option 2

pursue a retirement plan to ensure retireent. ere, different sub-option wereoutlined. 
There are differnt options to finance the retirement and also differnt retirement schemes to choose from. Someretirement optiona are only possible with specific financing decisions: e.g. state reirement is only possible when woman has a formal working contract with her husband or another employer.

## Model Inputs 

After receiving a calibration training in the DA-Course, we bacame calibrated. This is our input table. the estimates for our input table were based on a mixed approach of literature research and expert opinion. the uncertainties were assigned by us as "calibarated" experts. 
the model was then implemented in r.It is important to note, thet our model acknowlegesd the contemporary legal constraints in germany. we explicitly follow the available information on german pensio schemes as stated by pension consultants and extensionists.

```{r tables, echo=FALSE}
input_table_gender <-read.csv2("./input_table_gender_4th.csv", dec = ",")
knitr::kable(input_table_gender, caption = 'Input table')
# [1:5, ]
```

## Model inmpementation and specification 

The model was created with the @R-decisionSupport. We made use of the tools of the @R-tidyverse. 

We worked together with experts to derive a conceptual
model that explicitly identified all the important factors
and relationships in rension schemes for in-married woman in Agriculture
. Since the pension yield and input demand depend
on the age of the decision-maker, all benefits and costs were
modeled in relation to the age of the decision maker. Since the monthly
input costs varied throughout the employment biography,the 
maintenance costs were estimated corresponding to time
intervals specified by experts. Risks were quantified in the
model by simulating the likelihood and consequences of
events perceived as consequential for pension entitlement of woman.
