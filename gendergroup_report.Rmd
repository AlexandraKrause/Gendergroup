# Abstract
?In our project, we intend to work on gender equality in german farming?.

# Introduction

The ancient role model of the male, patriarch farmer is under deconstruction [@laoire_young_2002]. When looking at agricultural study courses, practical training classes and social media, several scholars perceive a "feminization" of agriculture in Germany [@inhetveen2017feminization] - This perception is reflected in agricultural statistics, stating that women make up more than 36 % of the agricultural workers, 23% of agricultural apprentices and 48% of agricultural students [@BZL2021]. More and more innovative and successful female farmers overcome traditional role models and claim their territory in this formerly male-dominated field [@padel2020arbeiten]. 

Unfortunately, this "feminization" is not reflected in the share of leadership positions and land ownership of women. Today, only 11 % of farm managers are female and only 1/3 of land is owned by females [@destatis2020; @tietz2021untersuchung]. The main reason for this being that women have very little chance of inheriting farm land, as the old-fashioned tradition of male farm succession is still common practice [@Padel2020]. Oftentimes, the only way to gain access to land is either by starting their own farming business or by marrying into an existing one. Unfortunately, most of the latter then take on the role of the farmers wife, a contributing family member or a seasonal worker [@destatis2020]. 
The statistically important group of women who married into farms is expected to do the office-, stable- and housework (e.g.cooking,cleaning), and to take care of the children and elderly. This way they contribute to the family business without adequate financial remuneration or security [SOURCE]. When considering old age and pension, it goes without saying that this arrangement puts her at a considerable disadvantage compared to her husband. This is true for housewives in general, however, it is important to note that the agricultural pension system in Germany is unique as it is loosely based on the idea of traditional family farms.
 
Traditionally, a farmers pension was secured by keeping the family business going by passing it down to his son. However, this system is challenged by structural changes of traditional family farms (e.g.decrease in small farms) [@glauben2009probability]. Currently, the pension of farmers in Germany is usually a combination of agricultural pension insurance, leasing income from property or monthly allowance from successors[@hagedorn1991financing]. Here, the pension payment from the insurance is not intended to cover the living costs but rather simply functions as pocket money [@BMEL2021]. Therefore, revenues of leasing land during retirement is an important supplement to the agricultural pension but legally goes exclusively to the land owner (i.e. the husband in most cases). The fact that farm property rights are unequally distributed in favor of men is also reflected in the farm decision making process- 40% of farmers' wives claim that their husband decides alone on the farm [@Umfrage]. In addition, eventhough farm wives can also be insured by the agricultural insurance, they often receive a lower pension than men for various reasons (e.g. contributing family members pay and receive less pension, fewer years of contibutuin etc.)[@BREG2017]. In short, despite working full-time on the farm, farmers' wives often lack decision making power (in regards to the farm) and are financially depend on their husbands and their in-laws.
 
The imbalance of a high workload on the one hand and a lack of proper financial compensation on the other does not yield an adequate pension. Additionally, divorce or death of the husband constitute major risks for a farm wives' pension. As a result, hard-working women on family farms bear a high risk of old-age poverty if they do not have a proper pension plan. However, acquiring independent pension entitlements is challenging for women on farms. First, their „patchwork employment biographies“ are disadvantageous in the German pension system and often lead to low pension payouts. Second, patriarchal traditions demand child and elderly care from women and this workload often does not allow for noteworthy off-farm employment in the first place. Third, oftentimes farm wives are not fully aware of their situations and/or of alternatives. Breaking out of old traditions has the potential to create new opportunities and financial security and independence, but it also contains risks and uncertainties.
 
In our study, we display different pension options that farm wives have. However, given the high system complexity, the long-term benefits of pension
schemes are difficult to anticipate. This study aimed to integrate uncertainty into long-term performance projections for pension scheme interventions in Germany by applying decision analysis and probabilistic modeling approaches to produce economic ex-ante assessments for pension schemes. With our research we would like to show that risks and uncertainties do not need to be a reason to stick to a status quo that discriminates against females in farming. We would like to encourage female farmers to be courageous and look into their options and not be satisfied with practice as usual.
 
# Decision

When looking at gender equality, the freedom to act of the group that is discriminated against is usually limited and entails a number of risks. That being the case we were particularly interested to investigate the decision making process and options from the woman's point of view. In order to do that we set up a realistic and specific case study.

Our decision maker can either stick to the status quo or decide for an intervention to improve her pension. 

Default option: 
In the default option our decision maker follows the traditional structures (i.e. contributing full time to the family business without renumeration),and relies on her husband and his farming business to secure her pension. In this case she is officially registered as a farm wife and the mandatory agricultural insurance is paid for her by her husband. 
 
Interventions to improve the pension:
In our model, we evaluate 14 different interventions where she pursues a pension plan to ensure financial security once she retires. There is a considerable amount of different pension schemes to chose from along with a number of possible ways to finance her pension independently of her husband (e.g. off-farm employment).



# Methods
After extensive literature research on female farmers in Germany, we identified the statistically important group of women married into farms and narrowed down the focus on the pension issue for these women in Germany. In order to illustrate possible options and interrelations that help to facilitate a decision making process, we created a first draft of a conceptual model (see Figure 4.1). In the course of this project we solely focused on the monetary values, excluding any emotional conditions and personal preferences, due to the limited scope and timeframe of this module.
Next, we took the participatory approach and reached out to stakeholders and experts to update our model. We then used the updated version \@ref(fig:draftmodel) as a guideline for our model code. The model was then created according to @R-decisionSupport. We also made use of the tools by @R-tidyverse. In a final step, this report was compiled using tools from the @R-knitr team.

## Decision maker
We characterized our decision maker as a 25 year old woman. The farm she married into is still owned by her in-laws resulting in her to be registered as a contributing family member for the next five years, until the farm is being transferred to her husband. During that time, the amount of money paid into her agricultural pension and the payout she will receive in old age are only half of that of her husband's. At the age of 30, her husband will become farm owner and her and her husband's status will be the same in regards to the agricultural pension. 
There are a number of additional individual characteristics that affect her options to take precautions for her financial future. We determined her to be a gardener by trade, she did not bring any noteworthy wealth or property into the marriage and the couple already has one young child.

## Draft of conceptual model
Our inital model draft was based on literature [@Padel2020] and personal experiences (Figure 4.1). It displays both decision options that lead to her pension i.e. the decision option 1 aka default option and decision option 2 of choosing a pension plan.
We chose the three most commonly mentioned ways in the literature to secure a safe pension, namely owning property, investing in private insurance and paying into state insurance. 
As ways to finance these pension schemes we decided on four different financing options. Self-emplyoment on the farm (e.g. as a gardener), setting up a co-ownership of the farm with her husband, convincing her in-laws/husband to pay her fully or working in her chosen profession as a gardner off farm. All of these options could be used for investment into property or private insurance. In order to make use of state insurance she would have to be officially employed on the farm, or take on an occupation off farm. 
In a brainstorming session, we collected different risks for each option. If she sticks to status quo (i.e. default option) she is financially dependend on her family-in-law. Events that could highly threaten her pension in this case are a possible divorce, a fatal accident at work of her husband, or bancruptcy of the farm.
Obstacles that we thought likely to make it difficult for her to choose a pension plan is the objection of the husband himself (called husband power in framework) and the need to cover child and eldery care, which is mainly seen as her responsibility.

## Stakeholders and Participatory approach 

We identified four major stakeholders in this decision. The farmer is the husband of our decision maker. He may depend on the support of his wife when running his farm. He may expect his wife to support him, as he most probably grew up on a farm, where his mother contributed without formal employment contract. Our second stakeholder category are children, who grow up on a farm and may encounter the expectations to take over the farm at some point. In case of a farm transfer, the successor child will take responsibility for the financial security of its parents during their pension. To minimize his/ her financial obligations, the successor should be in favor of a good pension plan. Our third stakeholder category are the in-laws of the decision maker. When the husband owns the farm and his wife supported him full time, the wife is self -sufficient in her pension but rather dependent on her husband. The in-laws may be sceptical about investing in the pension of the decision maker, because they believe in a lasting marriage. Another stakeholder are people who would like to start a farming business without inheriting one. Here, the 

Our next goal was to gain a better understanding of the actual and current pension situation of farmers wives' in Germany in order to define a realistic case of a decision maker and to update and adjust our initial conceptual model. For this, we first identified consultants in private as well as agricultural insurance companies (i.e social insurance for agriculture,forestry and horticulture SVLFG), the agricultural chamber (i.e. Landwirtschaftskammer Nordrhein-Westfalen), lawyers for agricultural family law and the German woman farmers association (i.e. deutscher Landfrauenverband) as our experts. We then conducted several interviews via phone and the video communications platform zoom.us. Additionally, we used the social networking sites facebook.com and instagram.com to approach potential decision makers (i.e.farm wives). We then organized an online workshop over zoom with the previously identified experts, stakeholders and potential decision makers \@ref(fig:invitation).


```{r invitation, echo=FALSE, out.width='50%', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Invitation to the Workshop", fig.show='hold'}

```



In total, 15 participants attended our workshop. Table \@ref(tab:stakeholdertable) shows an overview of the participants, their status in our research, and whether they partook in an interview and/or in the workshop.
After a brief introduction and a general initial discussion, the participants were given three questions, namely "What pension options does a farm wife have?" "What are potential risks and obstacles?" and "How could she finance the pension options?". After answering these questions in groups of three, we collected all thoughts and ideas in plenum. After a lively discussion we were able to update our model.

```{r stakeholdertable, caption= "stakeholdertable", echo=FALSE}
stakeholdertable <-read.csv2("./stakeholdertable.csv", dec = ",")
knitr::kable(stakeholdertable, caption ='Overview of participants, their status and type of contribution')

## Adjustment of conceptual model

Based on the outcomes of our research we adjusted and specified our decision option 2 (i.e. financing her own retirement plan) in our conceptual model \@ref(fig:draftmodel).

```{r draftmodel, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Adjusted decision option 2 pathways of financing her own retirement", fig.show='hold'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/Model_after_workshop_pension_plan.png')


# cite this figure with \@ref(fig:draftmodel)
```

As a first step we eliminated the options of farm co-ownership and self- emplyoment we previously considered as a possible financing option. We learned in the workshop that co-ownerships are hardly done in reality as it is not feasible for most farming businesses and self-employment of both parents is hardly manageable when simultaneuosly raising a child.
In the end, we were left with four financing options, we refer to as 'branches'.Three of which require intial investment costs in form of covering child and elderly care. Establishing an own branch on the farm itself, particuarly in form of setting up a farm shop, delivery service or holiday housing seemed to be popular among workshop participants. Identified risks for this option were the circumstance of divorce and the bancruptcy of the farm.
Getting an off farm job or negotiating with the in-laws to be officially employed at the farm was also mentioned frequently.Here, the risks are related to the farm and therefore identical with the ones for 'own branch on farm' (i.e. risk of divorce, bancruptcy).
Another option we had not thought of before the workshop is to receive money from her husband which she can then invest into a pension plan. The risks are equal to the default option as she would also rely on her husband for her pension (i.e. risk of divorce,bancruptcy, death of husband). 
When it comes to pension schemes, we excluded own property and only focused on the investment into different insurances, called 'ways'. We explicitly followed the available information on german pension schemes as stated by the pension consultants.
If choosing the options of own branch or receiving family money she would pay into the agricultural insurance by herself, and on top of that has the options to invest into private insurance or ETFS or a mix of both. The other two options of on and off farm job imply the mandatory state insurance, which she then could also boost with additional private insurance, ETFs or a mix.
We would like to highlight that the greatest obstacle to option 2 (i.e. pension plan) we were able identify from the workshop was in fact the husband/in-laws themselves. Every option in the retirement plan itself contains the risk, that they oppose her decision to plan for her retirement. Mainly because they do not see the necessity for it as farmers generally prefer to invest into their farming business rather than into their wives pension schemes. Additionally, the investment costs and having to find suitable child and eldery care is a further deterrent.This risk is illustrated by a black circle in the model and affects every option within the pension plan decision.
The default option and associated risks remained the same in the updated version. The only change was that of design to match the design of the new model \@ref(fig:defaultchunk).

## Model Inputs

The previous determination of our decision allowed us to fill our input table with values \@ref(tab:inputtable).
After receiving a calibration training in the DA-Course, we considered ourselves calibrated experts and were able to estimate reasonable ranges based on a mixed approach of literature reasearch and expert opinion.
The time frame of our intervention amounts to 40 years (i.e. retirement at the age of 65). Based on this and according to the methodology of @do_decision_2020, we tried to assign reasonable uncertainties given this long time horizon.
Based on her appointed profession as gardener, we estimated her possible yearly income and amount of payment into the different insurance options. We repeated this process for own farm branch, on farm job and receiving family money. Hereby, we agreed that she would be able to invest at least 10 % of her income into private insurance schemes (i.e. private insurance, ETFs, or mix of both). After retiring, it is likely that she lives and receives her pension for another 17 years until the age of 82, which is the average female life expectancy in Germany [@statistalife].
Pension estimation calculators such as a gross/net calculator [@brutto-netto-rechner,2021],a private pension calculator [@Allianz,2021],the agricultural rent estimator [@SVLFG,2021] and an etf savings plan calculator [@BlackRock,2021] were used to narrow down reasonable monetary amounts of each option within the pension plan option. Since pension payment and payouts are usually paid per month, we first used a monthly time unit in our code. However, doing that created a wide variety of variables for 684 months (40 years of working and paying into her pension plus 17 years of receiving pension) making it highly complicated to create a straightforward output.Therefore we decided to use yearly time untis instead as intended by @R-decisionSupport.

The payments into and payouts of the agricultural insurance depends on her status (i.e. wife of farm owner or contributing family member). In our case she is a contributing family member for five years, until her husband becomes farm owner. As soon as that happens the contributions into the insurance and her pension increase by 50%. It becomes obvious that a late farm transfer could have a negative impact on her pension.

## Coding the model

The model was created in accordance with @R-decisionSupport. It was run using a Monte-Carlo simulation with 10.000 repetitions.
Since the pension yield and input demand depend on the age of the decision maker, all benefits and costs were modeled in relation to individual circumstances of the decision maker (e.g. profession,age etc). The heart of our model are the yearly payments into agricultural or state pension for 40 years (€/year) and the yearly pension payout for 17 years (€/year). 


Our model entails 14 „ways“, divided according to different income sources in 4 branches. In each branch, she pays a mandatory insurance (either state or agricultural insurance). In addition there are differnt options to increase this mandatory insurance with personal investments like ETF, private insurance or a mix of both. Each of the 14 ways is compared to the default option (i.e. decision option 1). Here, our decision maker choses not to invest financially into her retirement and only relies on her husband/family-in-law since the mandatory agricultural insurance is paid by them.

*	Branch 1 = Default vs. Own farm branch (Way 1, 2, 3)
*	Branch 2 = Default vs. Off-Farm Job (Way 4, 5, 6, 7)
*	Branch 3 = Default vs. Payed on farm job (Way 8, 9, 10, 11)
*	Branch 4 = Default vs. Family money (Way 12, 13, 14) 

Our case study expands over 57 years and is split into a period of 40 years of payment and a period of 17 years of payout for each insurance option. For all insurances, investments and pensions we produced time series with variation, depicted here using the examples of agricultural insurance and private insurance having an off farm job. The abbreviation _inv_ represents the 40 working years in which she invests into her pension.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
  #Agricultural insurance
  Agri_insurance <- c(rep (0,working_years),vv(var_mean = Agri_insurance, 
                                               var_CV = var_slight, 
                                               n = pension_years))
  
  Agri_insurance_inv <- c(vv(var_mean =Agri_insurance_inv, 
                             var_CV = var_slight, 
                             n = working_years), rep(0,pension_years))

  #Private insurance
  Private_insurance_off_farm <- c(rep (0,working_years), vv(var_mean =Private_insurance_off_farm, 
                                                            var_CV = var_slight, 
                                                            n = pension_years))

  Private_insurance_inv_off_farm <- c(vv(var_mean =Private_insurance_inv_off_farm, 
                                         var_CV = var_slight, 
                                         n = working_years), rep(0,pension_years)
```

## Example Branch 1, way 1: Setting up her own business

In way 1, our decision maker sets up her own business branch. Analogue to the default option, she continues to be part of the agricultural insurance. Here however, she pays into it herself. 
On top, she invests about 10 % of her income into private insurance. 
In part A, her benefits from the private insurance and agricultural insurance were summed up, whereas part B sums up the cost for both insurances.

By subtracting the cost from the benefit, we obtained the NPV. The NPV was then discounted with a discount rate of 1. 
  
  
```{r, eval=FALSE } 
  PartA <- Private_insurance_own_branch + Agri_insurance
  PartB <- Agri_insurance_inv + Private_insurance_inv_own_branch
  profit_with_Own_business_branch_1 <- (PartA - PartB)
  
  NPV_profit_with_Own_business_branch_1 <- discount(profit_with_Own_business_branch_1,
                                                    discount_rate = 1, calculate_NPV = TRUE)
```

In the default option the agricultural insurance is paid for by the family. Therefore, the decision maker benefits from receiving pension without having invested any money herself. 

```{r, eval=FALSE }
  PartA <- Agri_insurance + Default_option
  PartB <- Agri_insurance_inv 
  # The variables Default_option and Agri_insurance_inv are equal and cancel each other out. 
  profit_Default <- (PartA - PartB)
  
  NPV_no_branch <- discount(profit_Default,
                            discount_rate = 1, calculate_NPV = TRUE) 
```  
  
To calculate the NPV of the decision, we subtracted the default option from way 1, as can be seen in the following example.

```{r, eval=FALSE }   
  NPV_decision_profit_with_Own_business_branch_1 <- NPV_profit_with_Own_business_branch_1 - NPV_no_branch
```                         
We performed this calculation on all 14 ways within the 4 branches.

Note from Julia: I think this example is enough for an explanation. They can access the whole code on GitHub.I would actually delete the next part from line 265-448


In way 2 she sets up her own business branch as well. She continues to be part of the agricultural insurance, and invests 10 % of her income in ETF. 
  
  PartA <- ETF_own_branch + Agri_insurance
  PartB <- Agri_insurance_inv + ETF_inv_own_branch
  
  profit_with_Own_business_branch_2 <- (PartA - PartB)
  
  
  NPV_profit_with_Own_business_branch_2 <- discount(profit_with_Own_business_branch_2,
                                                    discount_rate = discount_rate, calculate_NPV = TRUE)
  
  NPV_decision_profit_with_Own_business_branch_2 <- NPV_profit_with_Own_business_branch_2 - NPV_no_branch
  
In way 3 she also sets up her own business brance, continues to be part of the agricultural insurance, but contrary to the two previous ways, she invests about 10 % of her income in a Investment-Mix (i.e. ETFs and private insurance).
  
  PartA <- Mix_own_branch + Agri_insurance 
  PartB <- Agri_insurance_inv + Mix_inv_own_branch
  
  
  profit_with_Own_business_branch_3 <- (PartA - PartB)
  
  
  NPV_profit_with_Own_business_branch_3 <- discount(profit_with_Own_business_branch_3,
                                                    discount_rate = discount_rate, calculate_NPV = TRUE)
  
  NPV_decision_profit_with_Own_business_branch_3 <- NPV_profit_with_Own_business_branch_3 - NPV_no_branch
 
##Branch 2: Getting an off farm 
 
 In way 4 she gets an off-farm job. Here, she stops to be part of the agricultural insurance,and instead is part of the mandatory state insurance. She invests no additional income into her pension. 
  
  profit_with_off_farm_job_4 <- (State_insurance_off_farm - State_insurance_inv_off_farm)
  
  
  NPV_profit_with_off_farm_job_4 <- discount(profit_with_off_farm_job_4,
                                             discount_rate = discount_rate, calculate_NPV = TRUE)
  
  NPV_decision_profit_with_off_farm_job_4 <- NPV_profit_with_off_farm_job_4 - NPV_no_branch
  
 In way 5 her circumstances are the same as in way 4, the only difference here is that she chooses to invest 10% of her income into private insurance. 
   
  PartA <- Private_insurance_off_farm + State_insurance_off_farm 
  PartB <- Private_insurance_inv_off_farm + State_insurance_inv_off_farm 
  
  profit_with_off_farm_job_5 <- (PartA - PartB)
  
  
  NPV_profit_with_off_farm_job_5 <- discount(profit_with_off_farm_job_5,
                                             discount_rate = discount_rate, calculate_NPV = TRUE)
  
  NPV_decision_profit_with_off_farm_job_5 <- NPV_profit_with_off_farm_job_5 - NPV_no_branch
  
  
  Way 6 is analogous to way 4 and 5,however, here she invests a part of her income (i.e 10%) into ETFs. 
  
  PartA <- ETF_off_farm + State_insurance_off_farm 
  PartB <- State_insurance_inv_off_farm + ETF_inv_off_farm
  
  profit_with_off_farm_job_6 <- (PartA - PartB)
  
  
  NPV_profit_with_off_farm_job_6 <- discount(profit_with_off_farm_job_6,
                                             discount_rate = discount_rate, calculate_NPV = TRUE)
  
  NPV_decision_profit_with_off_farm_job_6 <- NPV_profit_with_off_farm_job_6 - NPV_no_branch
  
  In way 7 the only difference is that she invests a part of her income in a mixed investment (i.e. ETFs and private insurance). 
  
  PartA <- Mix_off_farm + State_insurance_off_farm
  PartB <- Mix_inv_off_farm + State_insurance_inv_off_farm
  
  
  profit_with_off_farm_job_7 <- (PartA - PartB)
  
  
  NPV_profit_with_off_farm_job_7 <- discount(profit_with_off_farm_job_7,

#Results and Discussion

Depending on the possibilities on the farm and in the region, our decision maker can chose among different sources of income. The decision maker may either start her own branch on the family farm, pursue an off-farm job, ask her husband for a formal working contract or ask her husband to pay for her retirement. 

Many of our decision options have a negative NPV. The reason is that we compared each of our ways to the default option, in which the woman receives very little retirement, but as her family covers the cost for the mandatory insurance, she has no cost at all. 

notes of alex: 
NPVs were calculated in euro/month (see plots)
i looked at lars script and remembered what they told us after the last presenttion. we still need this median npv plots. i will pick one branch and do one tomorrow

In the first branch our decision-maker sets up her own business branch on her husbands farm. Here, she continues to be part of the agricultural insurance, but also invests about 10 % of her income in private insurance, ETF or a mixed investment. 
In figure \@ref(fig:NPVbranch1) the NPVs from the decision clearly show, that these options are not attractive to our decision maker. Even tough the pension payout is considerably higher, the default option with the small pension comes for free.

In the second branch , our decision maker gets an off-farm job. Here, she stops to be part of the agricultural insurance.Instead, she is part of the mandatory state insurance.
Within this branch, the decision maker can either invest no income in pension or invest about 10% of her income in private insurance, ETF or mixed investment.
In figure \@ref(fig:NPVbranch2) the NPVs from the decision show, that only the investments in ETF and mixed investments are more attractive than the default. 
Even tough the pension payout with any pension plan is considerably higher than the default, the default option with the small pension comes for free.

In the third branch, our decision maker gets an official working contract and gets officially paid on farm by her husband. Here, she stops to be part of the agricultural insurance. Instead, she is part of the mandatory state insurance. With the income from this on farm job, the decision maker can either invests no income in pension or invest  about 10 % of her income in private insurance, ETF or mixed investment. 
In figure \@ref(fig:NPVbranch3) the NPVs from the decision show, that most options are not attractive to our decision maker. Even tough the pension payout is considerably higher, the default option with the small pension comes for free.

In the fourth branch, the decision maker convinces her husband to invest in her pension. Here, she continues to be part of the agricultural insurance,

She uses the money from her husband to invest in a private insurance or ETF or mixed investment.
In figure \@ref(fig:NPVbranch4) the NPVs from the decision show, that most options are barely more attractive than the default to our decision maker. Even tough the pension payout is considerably higher, the default option with the small pension comes for free.

(have to number the plots like a),b),...does someone know how? i failed)
 
The NPVs that differ the most from the baseline option were those of investing into ETF with a job away from the farm as well as investing into ETF and the investment mix with using family money. The last two options have a very broad range of loosing a lot of money or gaining much because of very broad ranges of investment and gain within the input estimates. This is because ......why are they so much higher than private insurance and state insurance payed with family money? is the money re-invested again and again? Then the model would not cover this re-investments properly and a function could be used instaed for a decision analysis in the future.


## Cashflow


```{r cashflow1, fig.cap = "Cashflow of way 1", echo=FALSE}
CashflowA <- plot_cashflow(mcSimulation_object = mcSimulation_results,
                           cashflow_var_name = "Cashflow_decision_gender_way_A",
                           x_axis_name = "Year",
                           y_axis_name = "Cashflow in Euro",
                           color_25_75 = "green4",
                           color_5_95 = "green1",
                           color_median = "red")
CashflowA

# cite this figure with \@ref(fig:cashflow1)

```
Visulised is the cashflow for the first option, a private insurance paid by having an own business branch using the plot_cashflow() function with the mcSimulation() outputs. 
The cashflow displays the biography of the decision maker. During the 40 years of work, the decision maker invests in her retirement. The payout is spread over the 17 years of pension. The cashflow shows how the structure of pension investments - decision makers have to deal with long years of investment and negative cashflow and the return comes only in old age. 

 
## PLS


```{r pls1, fig.cap = "PLS way 1", echo=FALSE}
pls_result_1 <- plsr.mcSimulation(object = mcSimulation_results,
                                resultName = names(mcSimulation_results$y)[3], ncomp = 1)
plot_pls(pls_result_1, threshold = 0.8)

# cite this figure with \@ref(fig:pls1)


```
Using a partial least square regression, the variable importance of a projection (VIP score) was produced as bar graphs.The model was more sensitive towards some variables, which are shown here. It shows which variables have the strongest impact on the outcome, but also the correlation with the outcome. The VIP shows the importance of the variables with a correlation of the output. The highest influences on the output are shown in the plot. Positive and negative values are visualised in comparison to the baseline option, showing whether their influence is more positive or negative than the baseline, also showing a positive or negative relationship with the outcome.

When checking the PLS for our differnet ways, it becomes apparent that the respective pension scheme has the highest impact. For example for way 1 our decision maker combines the mandatory agricultural insurance with private insurance. In the PLS, the investments in insurance appear negative whereas the payouts have a positive impact on the NPV of the decision. As our model is quite simple, this corresponds with our expectations. (See Fig. \@ref(fig:pls1)). When looking at the Pls of other 
alex note: name variables with a Variable Importance in Projection (VIP) value greater than one and describe them exemplary

##EVPI

To guide further research we conducted the expected value of perfect information analysis (EVPI) in a next step. EVPI represents the amount of money the decision maker should be willing to pay in order to reduce uncertainties of highly uncertain variables within the decision. The broader the ranges of upper and lower ranges for one variable in the calculation the higher the insecurity of the forecast. The result is a positive EVPI. Here, further research and getting more information about these variables can improve the forecasting model and decision recommendation. In short, the underlying idea is that more perfect information ensures making the right decision.

Our results revealed that only three ways (13,14,7) showed a positive EVPI, i.e high uncertainty. Ways 13 and 14 are part of branch 3, where the default option (i.e no pension plan) is compared to the option of receiving family money. In way 14 she invests this money into ETFs and in way 13 into a mix i.e ETFs and private insurance. Here, the variable mixed investment showed a positive EVPI of ..euro. This means, XY Euro should be invested in more research measuring the value of this variable in regards to the output. Way 13 showed the highest variance of lower and upper values in the input table, hence the estimated price to invest in further research is quite high.

A very low EVPI was not shown in any of the figures.

mcSimulation_table <- data.frame(mcSimulation_results$x, mcSimulation_results$y[c(1,710,711)])
evpi <- multi_EVPI(mc = mcSimulation_table, first_out_var = "NPV_profit_with_family_money_13")
plot_evpi(evpi, decision_vars = "NPV_decision_profit_with_family_money_13")


mcSimulation_table <- data.frame(mcSimulation_results$x, mcSimulation_results$y[c(1,769,770)])
evpi <- multi_EVPI(mc = mcSimulation_table, first_out_var = "NPV_profit_with_family_money_14")
plot_evpi(evpi, decision_vars = "NPV_decision_profit_with_family_money_14")

```{r EVPI1, fig.cap = "EVPI way 13, 14", echo=FALSE}

# cite this figure with \@ref(fig:EVPI1)
```

Way 7 (i.e. having a job away from the farm and adding a mixed private investment to her state insurance) showed a positive EVPI of.... euro. Hence, further research on this variable would be beneficial. 

Notes: include figure EVPI way 7 ?

In general, it can be said that a number of ways are a better choice than the baseline scenario (e.g ways 6,7,13), with ETFs and a mix with private insurance being the best investments with some exceptions. For instance, way 2 showed more negative values than the default option. As a conclusion it can be said that a monitoring plan seems to be recommendable.

Notes from Julia: I left this part out
-->Other ways with EVPI:11 and 2,too!!!! number 11 has a small x-axis because the values in the input table do not differ much. no 14 has as well as no 13 a wide boundary regarding the input, but the NPV is mostly negative. include more than the two? less?:


## Discount rate
Long-term payments directed to her retirement need high establishment and maintenance costs and will generate net losses in the first few years but return substantial benefits to the wife and family in the long term. Analogue to @do_decision_2020, best option for a decision maker may largely depend on their discount rate. In our model, we have used the dicount rate of 1. It would be desirable to provide a range of different discount rates, to incorporate the different dicout rates of different decision makers (see discussion).


## Risks
In our model building process, we identified several risks which have the potential to impair the model outcome (Table \@ref(tab:risktable)). We estimated the likelihood of these risks to occur and incooperated them in our initial version of the model. Also, we identified their potential impact on the NPV. However, implementing the risks lead to misleading results, as our code applied the risks over and over, and was not sensitive to the time in the employment biography of the woman.  


```{r risktable, caption= "riskitable", echo=FALSE}
risktable <-read.csv2("./risktable.csv", dec = ",")
knitr::kable(risktable, caption ='Risks')

# cite this table with \@ref(tab:risktable)
```

The main issues we encountered when applying our identified risks were due to the binominal distribution (0,1) and possible unlimited repetitions over our time period. For instance, the event that her husband passes away cannot occur repeatedly.The ongoing 0/1 distribution would have to end. The same is true for husband_risk meaning the power of the husband to stop his wives from engaging in official employment. 
Additionally, some risks would lower payment depending on when they occur, instead of causing a complete loss of pension if they occur. That is to say, if a farm wive pays into her insurances for years, she would still receive pension even if she stops paying in. This could be the case for example, if the farm goes bankrupt. A solution here could be a function that calculates exactly how the insurance determines the pension after a certain amount of years.
To complicate the matter even further, it was very difficult for us to assign realistic values for some of these risks e.g husband_risk.

There are a few possibilities to deal with these issues. 
Instead of using the risks of the decision function in the decision support package, new risk functions would have to be written for cases in which binomial distribution does not apply. However, this exceeds our capabilities and knowledge about specific insurance conditions. 
Another solution could be the use of the weibull-distribution. Here, a husbands risk to die for instance is not always the same, but differs with age and the differences over time, like in our case, could be implemented through this function.

--> (source: https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1479942/1479942.pdf)....how do i get sources in?
https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1472787/1472787.pdf). better sources: brandel et al. 2020, paul et al 2019 (i have them on my desctop)...i will write more text regarding this, but it is hard to explain...i will work on it in word first tomorrow) 

the diversity of investments or portfolio diversification referring to the modern portfolio theory could be implemented as well using a weilbull function for calculationg the risk of an investment failure like mentioned above and an utility function to calculate how risk affin the decision maker is (can we quote whiley books???)https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272157556_Modern_Portfolio_Theory_Capital_Market_Theory_and_Asset_Pricing_Models), so that a mixed investment would have an advantage over a single insurance for example (see the text i wrote for "discussion"-> not sure where to put it). With an utility function, the emotional choice of a farm wife to invest into something even though she might face discussions with her husband could be included into the simulation as well. It would cover her risk adversion regarding inner familiary problems. Since the utility functions "slope of an indifference curve reflects the fact
that investors require a higher expected return in order to accept higher risk",the process of deciding for or against an option with the knowledge of conflics could be estimated
(https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272157556_Modern_Portfolio_Theory_Capital_Market_Theory_and_Asset_Pricing_Models).


##Discussion (alex: should we really put both together?)
To answer the question, how risks could be better implemented in cases like this where binominal distributions are unfortunately, the use of a weibull-distribution would be fortunate. A husbands risk to die for example is not always the same, it differs with age. These differences over time could be implemented through this function. It is rather unusual to assume family conflicts every year because of a job away from the farm and therefore a possibility to quit the job. This also was shown during the workshops. The power of the husband on his wives decision would decrease in this cases after the decision was made and then probably stop existing if not directly after taking an off-farm job. The weilbull-distribution would cover this decreasing risk better as well. Further workshops could cover the need for more information regarding this input estimate. The risk of bankruptcy affecting the pension also decreases with years of paying into the insurance. An early bankruptcy affects the pension much more than a late one until it will stop affecting the decision makers pension when the retirement starts. This of course only focuses on the effects on retirement, not other effects of bancruptcy. With these few examples the need for a function like the Weibull-distribution covering the risks instead of a binominal distribution in this case is shown (source: brandel et al. 2020, paul et al 2019 (how to put them in?).

the diversity of investments or portfolio diversification referring to the modern portfolio theory could be implemented as well using a weilbull function for calculating the risk of an investment failure like mentioned above and an utility function to calculate how risk affine the decision maker is (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272157556_Modern_Portfolio_Theory_Capital_Market_Theory_and_Asset_Pricing_Models), so that a mixed investment would have an advantage over a single insurance for example (see the text i wrote for "discussion"-> not sure where to put it). With an utility function, the emotional choice of a farm wife to invest, even though she might face discussions with her husband could be included into the simulation as well. It would cover her risk adversion regarding inner familiary problems. Since the utility functions "slope of an indifference curve reflects the fact that investors require a higher expected return in order to accept higher risk",the process of deciding for or against an option with the knowledge of conflics could be estimated

## Problems/Obstacles/Uncertainties/what we did not implemement
There are severalrisks, that would even decrease the value of the default option. 

Risk of no /late farm transfer: In our Model the Farm is transfered to the husband in time.  It is important to keep in mind that this is not always the case. As we learned in the workshop (see section Participatory research), a large number of farms chose to cancel the woman's agricultural pension because they prefer to invest the money into the farm directly.Also, the transfer of a family farm to the successor is oftentimes not a smooth process and might be realized later then expected. when the farm actually does not belong to the partner, but still to the parents in law, the situation of the woman is very insecure. She will not be registered as a wife. Without marriage, she can not be registered as a contributing family member. 

Case of no marriage: When the woman is not married but "only" a partner, she will mot be eligible to the agricultural pension. If she does not pursue an outside job, she is not eligible for any pension. 

Within the scope of this model, it was not possible to include the emotinal hurdles to pursue the rationally mot advisabme way. in our workshop woman emphazized, that asking for money is such a big step thyat many woman are to shy to even ask. Whith our model, we may identify the most attractive option in monetary terms, but probanly the monetary terms are not the most important one for woman. 

child care & elderly care was difficult to implemement into the our model. Initially, we included child and elderly care as a cost. however, this cost in combination with the cost for pension investment mader the desion NPV incredibly negative. For the sake of a simple model we left it out, however, it would be desirable to include it in future.  



Uncertainties related to the communication culture in farming families, farmers’ values, farm profitability, and pension returns appear to have the great influence on whether a retirement plan emerges as the preferable option. Better access to information and self confidence to ask for a fair share of farming income are prerequisites to implement pension plans for in-married woman in german farms. Narrowing these key knowledge gaps may offer additional clarity on farmers’ wives optimal course of action and provide guidance for agencies promoting insurance interventions in Germany. Our model produced a set of plausible ranges for net present values and highlighted critical variables, more clarity on which would support decision-making under uncertainty. Our research approach proved effective in providing forecasts of uncertain outcomes and can be useful for informing family farms pursuing a pension plan.-->IS THAT TRUE? I THOUGHT OUR MODEL WAS RATHER CONFUSING (alex: i have to read it again tomorrow and will answer then)

Alex:

Decisions like insurance investments are very complicated to be done with the decision support package.Binominal risks, that develop to consist over the long time period and lead to total failure of the decision if occuring were not appropriate for this model, where risks had to change and should only change the monetary values instead of leading to zero payouts.The intention of the cost function had to be changed from covering yearly revenues and costs to covering payments over many years, which were separated from the receivings over many years. Many different options had to be included into a very large function, which lead to problems detecting errors.An appropritae discount rate was hard to implement due to the very fortunate baseline option, that was very high without risks adapted to it. Not only did the monetary inflation during corona rise to record hights, it is also complicated to estimate the willingness of a female farm wife to invest. This is especially hard since the willingness might differ from a male farm owner.

(more text about cashflow....?i will think of sth)(wrrite more about vv function and variability)
-> and 2 ways missing: only 14 instaed of 18 because with old table  2 ways were too close to default option..describe which ways and why and why new table could make a difference (could it make a difference? need to look into it again...)
## Recommendation 
Right mixture of options is important --> for each individual case--> depends on age, wealth before wedding, profession, in-laws (whether they see the need for a retirement plan) etc. 

Annual profits from farming mostly benefit the farm owner, which is rarely is the women. Farmers likely prefer reinvesting the available money in farming technology due to the relatively early incomes and short time-lag on returns. However, structural changes in agriculture and the high give-up rates impose high insecurity on the future of the farm and may raise the awareness for proper pension plans.

EVPI: give out money for those variables that need to be observed. Especially the variable ETF payed by family money (option 13) should be further observed, having a very wide range between upper and lower values as estimated values. Asking a decision maker for input estimates or getting various suggestions during another workshop in the future would clear the range of this value. The value of mixed investment payed by family money should also be further researched. The value of the mixed investment payed by the off-farm job could be further invested as well.


# Conclusion
EVPI and Mix super, but model has boundaries. probably with implementation of risks,..mix better could be better than evpi (portfolio diversification) and more options better than default. s.th. about why it is risky to choose default and one of those different options would be good for a farm wive. More information for farm wives, social pressure and boundarys to make a decision. good for next generation, children do not have to care for her,....

We present approaches for securing pension and retirement for the farm wives in Germany. We apply the gathered knowledge from both experts and stakeholders in the design and conceptualization of models for the cost, benefits, risks, and uncertainties related to the decision of choosing the various options for her pension. The models implemented differ on the returns it could provide for the farmwives paying for 40 years before her retirement. The investment to spend depends on the source of income. The benefits then are compared first to the default option in which she can have an insurance pension without spending an amount because her husband or her family covers it for her. Additionally, when other options are compared to each other, the combination of having an off-farm job and investing with ETF provides her a better cash flow during the 17 years after her retirement age.
However, the model needs more consideration on the risks and uncertainties involved. The decision-maker may be affected by the loss (also by accident on the farm) of her husband (if married). Her responsibility for the child and elderly care would also affect her decision to get the insurance plan. The current rate of divorce in Germany may also affect the turnover of the husband’s estate. This could be added to the rate of bankruptcy. All the risks considered would not affect whether she could have a pension at the end but would surely affect the amount she could get.
Our study would see it as an outlook that there should be more interventions and opportunities for farm wives to improve their potential benefits from the pension plan she pays either from agricultural, state, or private insurance. Policies that demand a monetary appreciation of their work may add value to her future retirement pension. The results and methods of this study open the door to future studies on the empowerment of farm wives and for further analyses of their contribution to the development of agricultural interventions.
